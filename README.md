## About the project

This is my current project for learning full-stack development with Python. It's hosted on Railway and uses a proper database setup with API endpoints. The goal is to create a complete tour booking platform, but there's still a lot of work to do.

The database architecture is set up and the basic API is working, but I'm still optimizing performance and adding features.
